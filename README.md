Foundations of Modern Machine Learning 

**MODULE 1 LAB 1 :** Covers basics of python and some libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib and Nltk.

Strings, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries, and indexing

Functions

numpy library: np.array, np.arange, np.eye, np normal multiplication, np point wise multiplication, np transpose, convert even elements of matrix to zero, figure out shape of matrix

Reading files: open(), read_csv(), perform some operations on dataframes and data visualization, upload image from google drive using imread. 

**MODULE 1 LAB 2 :** Introduce data and features 

Extracting features from data: generating some random data using numpy and performing data visualization 

Features of text: Download documents from Wikipedia, clean it, ount the frequency of each character in a text and plot it in a histogram,  bigrams, visualize bigrams using heatmap, top 10 ngrams for each text

Features from written numbers: MNIST dataset, visualize few images, sum of pixel values, visualize sum of pixel values for 0 and 1, count the number black pixels that are surrounded on four sides by non-black pixels, or "hole pixels", visualize, plot for comparision, number of boundary pixels in each image, visualize, plot for comparision

Features from CSV file: california_housing_train.csv, scatter plot visualization of three features(columns in dataset), exercise: did the same with iris dataset.
